The goal of the project is to answer to some competency questions. Due to some unforeseen errors we can explored the graph. We have create the graph with the data set of the point of interest in Trentino. When we try to importe the RDF file in GraphDB or other similar tool the find a nil graph. We tried to fix it by remake the link between ontology and data in the linker tool (Karma).
